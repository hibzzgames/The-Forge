# Fork of The Forge
The Forge is a cross-platform renderer made by [ConfettiFx](https://theforge.dev/). Learn more about it from their official [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge).

This fork is used to maintain a stripped down version of The Forge such that it can included as a git submodule in custom engines using CMAKE. We currently use it in the Bread Engine's rendering module.

Please direct any question related to how The Forge works to the source repo.
